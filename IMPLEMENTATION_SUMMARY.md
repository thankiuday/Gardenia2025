## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Scanning Flow:
```
User scans QR code
    ↓
System validates registration
    ↓
Displays participant info
    ↓
User clicks "Allow Entry" or "Decline Entry"
    ↓
System fetches complete registration data
    ↓
Saves to AllowedEntry or DeclineEntry collection
    ↓
Returns confirmation
```

### 2. Admin Export Flow:
```
Admin logs in
    ↓
Views dashboard with entry statistics
    ↓
Clicks export button (or calls API)
    ↓
System fetches all entries from MongoDB
    ↓
Formats data for Excel with proper columns
    ↓
Generates .xlsx file with compression
    ↓
Sends file to admin's browser
    ↓
Browser downloads Excel file
```
