# Skip Student Type Modal for Closed Registration

## Change Summary

### Problem
When users tried to access the registration page for a closed event (like Rap Arena), they would first see the "Are you a Garden City University student?" modal, and only after closing it would they see the "Registration Closed" message.

### Solution
Modified the Registration page to skip the student type selection modal entirely when registration is closed, showing the "Registration Closed" message immediately.

## Changes Made

### File: `frontend/src/pages/Registration.jsx`

#### Change 1: Skip Modal When Registration is Closed
```javascript
// In useEffect when event is fetched:
if (eventWithId.registrationOpen === false) {
  setShowStudentTypeModal(false);
  setIsGardenCityStudent(false); // Set a default value
}
```

#### Change 2: Double-Check in Render Condition
```jsx
{/* Student Type Modal */}
<AnimatePresence>
  {showStudentTypeModal && event && event.registrationOpen !== false && (
    {/* Modal content */}
  )}
</AnimatePresence>
```

## User Experience

### Before:
1. User clicks "Register" for Rap Arena
2. ❌ Student type modal appears: "Are you a Garden City University student?"
3. User must close the modal
4. ✅ Then sees "Registration Closed" message

### After:
1. User clicks "Register" for Rap Arena
2. ✅ **Immediately sees "Registration Closed" message**
3. No modal appears
4. Cleaner, more direct user experience

## What Users See Now

When trying to register for the Rap Arena event (or any closed event):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🚫 Registration Closed                     │
│                                             │
│  Registration for Gardenia 2K25: The Rap   │
│  Arena is currently closed. Please check   │
│  back later or browse other events.        │
│                                             │
│  [Browse Other Events]  [Go Home]          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**No student type modal!** Just the closed message.

## Technical Details

### Modal Skipping Logic
- When event loads, check `registrationOpen` field
- If `false`, immediately set `showStudentTypeModal = false`
- Modal render condition also checks `event.registrationOpen !== false`
- This provides double protection against the modal showing

### Backward Compatibility
- Events with `registrationOpen = true` (or undefined) work normally
- Student type modal still appears for open events
- Only closed events skip the modal

## Benefits

✅ **Better UX**: Users immediately see why they can't register
✅ **No Confusion**: Don't need to interact with modal first
✅ **Cleaner Flow**: Direct to the point
✅ **Consistent**: Works for any closed event, not just Rap Arena

## Testing

### To Test:
1. Navigate to: `/register/68dd4dce04b7580301ca3537` (Rap Arena)
2. **Expected**: Immediately see "Registration Closed" message
3. **Not Expected**: Student type modal should NOT appear

### For Open Events:
1. Navigate to any other event registration page
2. **Expected**: Student type modal appears normally
3. Works as before

## Notes

- This change only affects the **Registration page**
- Other pages (Home, Events, Event Details) already handle closed registrations correctly
- The modal skipping is automatic based on the `registrationOpen` field in the database
- No additional configuration needed
