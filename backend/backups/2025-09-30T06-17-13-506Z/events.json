Students are invited to craft quirky yet logical concepts inspired by genetics and present them through mock advertisements, skits, or live demos. From DNA-powered energy drinks and glow-in-the-dark plants to mutation-proof gadgets and genetically engineered pets, participants can let their ideas run wild while keeping a clear link to genetic principles. The event is all about blending creativity, scientific understanding, and performance. In Round 1: Gene Pitch, teams will be given a random genetic element (like CRISPR, mutations, or plasmids) and must deliver a 30-second invention pitch. The most original and logical ideas will move to Round 2: Genetic Ad/Innovation Show, where teams present a 3-minute skit or ad for their fictional genetic product. Humor, innovation, and teamwork will be key. Props such as lab coats, toy microscopes, or DNA models will be provided on the spot to spark creativity, and participants can bring their own as well. The aim is not professional acting, but to showcase wit, imagination, and science in an entertaining way.",

    "description": "A popular tabletop game of skill and strategy, often called \"finger snooker.\" Players use a \"striker\" to flick and pocket smaller wooden discs (carrom men) into corner pockets. The aim is to pocket all pieces of your assigned colour (white or black) and finally the red queen. It requires a steady hand, precise aim, and strategic thinking to block opponents.",
    "rules": [
      "Player takes turns to strike. The striker must be flicked and cannot be pushed.",
      "The striker must be positioned within the baseline circles and must contact both front lines.",
      "Pocketing the striker is a foul, resulting in the loss of a turn and the return of one pocketed piece.",
      "To pocket the red Queen, a player must also pocket a subsequent piece of their own color (\"cover\" the Queen).",
      "The winner is the first to pocket all carrom men of their color. If the Queen is covered, 5 extra points are added.",
      "Under normal condition, the 29 points system is followed. In case there is a shortage of time, we will follow the best-of-five system."

The game is incredibly quick, requiring lightning-fast reflexes, spin control, and precise placement. Points are scored when an opponent fails to return the ball within the rules. Matches are typically best-of-five or best-of-seven games.",
