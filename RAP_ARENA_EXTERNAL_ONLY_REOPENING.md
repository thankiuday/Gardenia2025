# Rap Arena Registration - External Students Only Reopening

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to reopen Rap Arena registration exclusively for external students while preventing Garden City University (GCU) students from registering.

## Date of Implementation
October 14, 2025

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Backend - Database Update
**File:** `backend/scripts/reopenRapArenaForExternal.js`

**Action:** Executed the script to reopen Rap Arena registration in the database

**Result:**
```
✅ Successfully reopened registration for Rap Arena event
⚠️  Registration is now open ONLY for EXTERNAL students
   GCU students will be blocked from registering

Event Details:
- Title: Gardenia 2K25: The Rap Arena
- Registration Open: true
- Event Date: 16th October 2025
```

**Note:** The backend registration route (`backend/routes/registrations.js` lines 59-65) already had the logic to block GCU students:
```javascript
// Special check for Rap Arena - Allow ONLY external students
if (event.title === 'Gardenia 2K25: The Rap Arena' && isGardenCityStudent === true) {
  return res.status(403).json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Registration for Rap Arena is currently open only for external students. GCU students cannot register at this time.'
  });
}
```

### 2. Frontend - WelcomeModal Component
**File:** `frontend/src/components/WelcomeModal.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Added a prominent warning banner above the registration button
- Updated the registration button text to clarify it's for external students only

**UI Elements Added:**
```
⚠️ Registration Now Open for EXTERNAL STUDENTS ONLY
GCU students cannot register at this time
```

### 3. Frontend - Home Page
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Added a conditional warning banner in the Rap Arena section
- Updated the registration button text
- Banner only shows when registration is open

**UI Elements Added:**
```
⚠️ Registration Now Open for EXTERNAL STUDENTS ONLY
Garden City University students cannot register for Rap Arena at this time. 
Only external participants are eligible.
```

### 4. Frontend - Registration Page
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Registration.jsx`

**Changes:**
1. **Modal Warning:** Added a warning banner in the student type selection modal
2. **Button Logic:** Modified `handleStudentTypeSelection` function to block GCU students with an alert
3. **Date Information:** Updated the modal footer to clarify that only external students can register

**Key Modifications:**

**a) Warning Banner in Modal:**
```
⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE
Rap Arena registration is currently ONLY OPEN FOR EXTERNAL STUDENTS. 
GCU students cannot register at this time.
```

**b) Blocking Logic:**
```javascript
const handleStudentTypeSelection = (isGCUStudent) => {
  // Special handling for Rap Arena - Block GCU students
  if (event && event.title === 'Gardenia 2K25: The Rap Arena' && isGCUStudent === true) {
    alert('⚠️ Registration Restricted\n\nRap Arena registration is currently open ONLY for EXTERNAL STUDENTS. Garden City University students cannot register at this time.\n\nPlease check back later for updates or contact the event organizers for more information.');
    return; // Don't close the modal
  }
  ...
}
```

**c) Updated Date Information:**
```
External Students Only: Event on 16th October 2025
GCU students cannot register for this event
```

## User Experience Flow

### For External Students:
1. Visit the homepage → See registration is open with "External Students Only" notice
2. Click register → Select "No, I'm an external participant" in the modal
3. Fill out registration form with external student fields
4. Successfully register for the event

### For GCU Students:
1. Visit the homepage → See clear notice that only external students can register
2. If they try to register → See warning in the modal
3. If they click "Yes, I'm a GCU student" → Receive a blocking alert message
4. Cannot proceed with registration

## Backend API Protection

The backend API already has validation to reject GCU students at the server level, providing a secure double-layer protection:

```javascript
// Lines 59-65 in backend/routes/registrations.js
if (event.title === 'Gardenia 2K25: The Rap Arena' && isGardenCityStudent === true) {
  return res.status(403).json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Registration for Rap Arena is currently open only for external students. GCU students cannot register at this time.'
  });
}
```

## Color Scheme & Styling

All warning banners use a consistent orange/yellow gradient design for high visibility:
- Background: `from-orange-100 to-yellow-100`
- Border: `border-orange-300`
- Text: `text-orange-800` for headings, `text-orange-700` for body text

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Database script executed successfully
- [x] Backend validation in place
- [x] WelcomeModal shows external-only notice
- [x] Home page shows external-only notice
- [x] Registration modal shows warning banner
- [x] GCU students are blocked from registering
- [x] External students can register successfully
- [x] No linting errors in modified files

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/components/WelcomeModal.jsx`
2. `frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx`
3. `frontend/src/pages/Registration.jsx`

## Files Executed (Not Modified)

1. `backend/scripts/reopenRapArenaForExternal.js`

## Notes

- The changes are specific to "Gardenia 2K25: The Rap Arena" event only
- All other events remain unaffected
- The system uses title-based matching to identify the Rap Arena event
- Multiple layers of protection ensure GCU students cannot bypass the restriction

## Future Considerations

To revert these changes or open registration for GCU students:
1. Run `backend/scripts/closeRapArenaRegistration.js` (if needed to close completely)
2. Remove the special conditions from the frontend components
3. Remove or modify the backend validation in `backend/routes/registrations.js`
