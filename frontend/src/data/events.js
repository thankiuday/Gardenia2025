It provides a platform for participants to express complex biological ideas in a simple, engaging, and visually appealing manner. For School Students (9th–12th), the focus is on the exciting world of bioinformatics. Students of classes 9 and 10 will explore the applications of bioinformatics in agriculture, such as improving crop yield, disease resistance, and sustainable farming. Students of classes 11 and 12 will highlight applications of bioinformatics in healthcare, like personalized medicine, genetic research, and disease prediction. The aim is to blend scientific knowledge with creativity so that the posters or infographics can both inform and inspire. For Undergraduate and Postgraduate students, the challenge takes a technological turn with the App Development Idea Poster Competition. Participants will present a unique app concept that integrates biology and technology. The posters should explain the idea, outline the features of the app, and showcase its possible impact on society.",
